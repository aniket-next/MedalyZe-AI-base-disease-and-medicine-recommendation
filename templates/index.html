                        <p>A symptom checker is a tool that allows users to enter symptoms, as well as other medical and demographic information, to get a list of possible medical conditions. Symptom checkers can be used as a starting point to get a medical diagnosis from a doctor. Whether you have a sore throat, an itch, a bad case of sneezes, abdominal pain, or fatigue, you can enter these common symptoms to explore their potential causes.</p>

                        <p>While it's not a substitute for professional medical advice, you can get a better idea of what might be causing that sore throat or abdominal pain. Our symptom checker utilizes sophisticated natural language processing software that is applied to a medical database of disease information consisting of thousands of different health conditions. You'll be asked to enter your symptoms using everyday language and answer a few basic questions about your health, age, sex, and location. The combination of symptoms and health information is analyzed by an enhanced machine learning model that produces a list of possible matching conditions, such as the flu or many other ailments. You can then research those conditions and locate doctors to help diagnose and treat them.</p>

                        One study reported that for people living with a rare disease, it takes an average of nearly 5 years between onset of symptoms and correct diagnosis. In that time, they see an average of over 7 physicians each. And over half of patients agreed with the statement, ‚ÄúBecause of a slow diagnosis, treatment was delayed and the impact on my condition has been negative.‚Äù MediFind aims to speed up the process of finding the correct diagnosis with the help of your physician.</p>
